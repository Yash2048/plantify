# **Plantify - A Smart Plant Identification & Care Guide** 🌿

## **Overview**

**Plantify** is a Jupyter Notebook-based AI project for plant identification and care guidance. It uses machine learning to classify plant species and provides tailored care instructions, including watering schedules, sunlight needs, and soil recommendations.

## **Features**

✅ **Plant Identification** - Uses an AI model to recognize plant species  
✅ **Care Instructions** - Offers customized guidelines for plant maintenance  
✅ **Image Processing** - Employs computer vision for classification  
✅ **Performance Metrics** - Provides model accuracy, loss, and inference time  
✅ **Data Visualization** - Displays insights on plant health and classification results

## **Model Details**

- **Architecture:** CNN-based model (ResNet/MobileNet) for plant classification
- **Dataset:** Trained on a diverse dataset of plant images
- **Performance:**
  - **Accuracy:** ~92% on test data
  - **Inference Speed:** ~50ms per image on a GPU
  - **Loss:** Optimized using categorical cross-entropy
- **Preprocessing:** Uses OpenCV for image augmentation and normalization

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python** 🐍
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📓
- **TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch** 🤖
- **OpenCV** 📸
- **Pandas & Matplotlib** 📊
